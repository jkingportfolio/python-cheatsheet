`pd.DataFrame(data)` creates a DataFrame from the given data.<br>
`print(df)` displays the DataFrame.<br>

## Installation

Before you start coding in Python, you need to install the Python interpreter on your system. Here's how you can do it:

### Installing Python

1. **Download**: Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python.

2. **Run Installer**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard's instructions. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

3. **Verification**: Open a command prompt (or terminal) and type `python --version` to verify that Python has been installed successfully. You should see the installed version number.

## Using the Python Interpreter

Once Python is installed, you can use the Python interpreter to run your code.

### Interactive Mode

To start the interactive mode, simply open a command prompt (or terminal) and type `python`. This allows you to enter Python code directly and see the output immediately.

```python
$ python
Python 3.9.6 (default, Jun 29 2021, 06:20:32)
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello, Python!")
Hello, Python!
>>>
```

To exit the interactive mode, type exit() or press Ctrl + Z (Windows) or Ctrl + D (Unix-like systems).

Running Python Scripts
To run a Python script saved in a file (e.g., my_script.py), open a command prompt (or terminal) and navigate to the folder containing the script. Then, run the script using the command:

``` python
python my_script.py
```
Example Code
Here's a simple "Hello, World!" script:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
In the above code, `print("Hello, World!")` displays the message "Hello, World!" on the console.

Now that you have Python installed, you're ready to start coding in this versatile language!


## Dependencies and Creating a requirements File

You should create a `requirements.txt` file for your Python project as soon as you start adding external dependencies to your project. This ensures that you maintain a record of the specific packages and their versions that your project depends on. Here are some guidelines on when to create a `requirements.txt` file:

**When You Add External Packages:**
As soon as you start using external Python packages in your project, it's a good idea to create a `requirements.txt` file. This helps you keep track of the dependencies and their versions, making it easier to recreate the same development environment later.

**When Collaborating with Others:**
If you're collaborating with other developers, a `requirements.txt` file becomes even more important. It ensures that everyone working on the project is using the same set of dependencies, reducing the chances of compatibility issues.

**Before Deploying or Sharing Your Code:**
Before deploying your project to production or sharing it with others, you should update your `requirements.txt` file to include all the necessary dependencies. This ensures that others can set up the same environment and run your code without any issues.

**Regular Maintenance:**
It's a good practice to update your `requirements.txt` file whenever you add, update, or remove dependencies. This keeps the file accurate and up to date with the current state of your project's dependencies.

**Using Virtual Environments:**
If you're using virtual environments (which is recommended), it's a good idea to create a `requirements.txt` file as soon as you've set up your virtual environment and installed the necessary packages within that environment.

In essence, creating a `requirements.txt` file early in your project's development helps establish good practices and ensures that you have a clear record of your project's dependencies. This makes it easier to manage the development, collaboration, and deployment of your Python project.

**Using `requirements.txt` to Install Dependencies:**
Once you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all the required packages and their versions, you can easily set up your development environment on another system by following these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # On macOS and Linux
    .\venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Verify Installed Packages:**
    After installation, you can verify that the packages are installed by running:
    ```bash
    pip list
    ```

4. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**
    When you're done working with your project, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

Using the `requirements.txt` file in this way helps ensure that your development environment matches the one you used to develop your project. It's a convenient method to set up and manage dependencies, especially when sharing your code with others or deploying it to different systems.

Remember to keep your `requirements.txt` file up to date as you add or modify dependencies during the course of your project's development.



## Syntax

Python's syntax is known for its simplicity and readability. Let's explore some of the basic syntax rules.

### Indentation

Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords to indicate blocks of code, Python uses indentation. Indentation is crucial for defining code blocks and maintaining readability.

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented correctly")
else:
    print("This is also indented correctly")
```

### Comments
Comments are used to add explanations or notes to your code and are ignored by the Python interpreter.

#### This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line
comment
"""

Statements and Lines
Python statements are typically written one per line. However, you can use a backslash \ to continue a statement onto the next line.

```python
total = 10 + \
        20 + \
        30

print(total)
```

Quotation Marks for Strings
Strings can be enclosed in either single (' ') or double (" ") quotation marks.

``` python

single_quoted = 'This is a single-quoted string'
double_quoted = "This is a double-quoted string"
```

### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the basic syntax of Python:

```python
# This is a simple Python program
name = "Alice"
age = 30

if age >= 18:
    print(name + " is an adult.")
else:
    print(name + " is a minor.")
```

In the above code:

`name` and `age` are variables.<br>
`if` and `else` are control flow statements.<br>
`print()` is a built-in function used to display output.<br>
Understanding Python's syntax is the first step towards writing effective and readable code!



## Variables

Variables are used to store and manage data in Python. They are like containers that hold different types of information.

### Variable Naming Rules

- Variable names can consist of letters (uppercase/lowercase), digits, and underscores.
- They must start with a letter or an underscore (_), followed by letters, digits, or underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `myVar` and `myvar` are different).

### Assigning Values to Variables

You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=).

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.8
is_student = True
```


## Data Types

Python has various built-in data types:

Integers: Whole numbers, e.g., 5, -10.<br>
Floats: Numbers with decimal points, e.g., 3.14, -0.5.<br>
Strings: Sequences of characters, e.g., "Hello, Python!".<br>
Booleans: Represents True or False values.<br>
Lists: Ordered collections, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].<br>
Tuples: Similar to lists, but immutable, e.g., (1, 2, 3).<br>
Sets: Unordered collections with unique values, e.g., {1, 2, 3}.<br>
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}.<br>

In Python, data types define the kind of value a variable can hold. Here are some fundamental data types:

### Numbers

Numbers in Python can be classified into two main categories: integers and floating-point numbers.

#### Integers

Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point. They can be positive, negative, or zero.

```python
positive_integer = 42
negative_integer = -10
zero = 0
```

### Floating-Point Numbers
Floating-point numbers (floats) represent numbers with decimal points.

```python
positive_float = 3.14
negative_float = -0.5
```

### Strings
Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotation marks.

```python
single_quoted = 'This is a single-quoted string.'
double_quoted = "This is a double-quoted string."
multiline_string = '''This is a
multiline string.'''
```
You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation and slicing.

```python
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
```

### Booleans
Booleans represent two values: True or False. They are often used in conditions and logical operations.

``` python
is_adult = True
is_student = False
```

### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of numbers, strings, and booleans in Python:

```python
# Numbers
age = 25
height = 5.9

# Strings
greeting = "Hello"
name = "Bob"
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"

# Booleans
is_qualified = True
is_employee = False

print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Message:", message)
print("Is qualified?", is_qualified)
```

In the above code:

Various types of numbers, strings, and booleans are declared and used.
String concatenation is shown in the message variable.
The `print()` function is used to display the values.
Understanding these fundamental data types is essential for writing Python programs effectively!



## Operators

Operators in Python are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are a fundamental part of programming, allowing you to manipulate data and perform calculations.

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

```python
x = 10
y = 3

addition = x + y
subtraction = x - y
multiplication = x * y
division = x / y
modulus = x % y
exponentiation = x ** y

print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)
print("Modulus:", modulus)
print("Exponentiation:", exponentiation)
```

### Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values.

```python
a = 5
b = 10

equal = a == b
not_equal = a != b
greater_than = a > b
less_than = a < b
greater_than_equal = a >= b
less_than_equal = a <= b

print("Equal:", equal)
print("Not Equal:", not_equal)
print("Greater Than:", greater_than)
print("Less Than:", less_than)
print("Greater Than or Equal:", greater_than_equal)
print("Less Than or Equal:", less_than_equal)
```

### Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

```python
p = True
q = False

logical_and = p and q
logical_or = p or q
logical_not = not p

print("Logical AND:", logical_and)
print("Logical OR:", logical_or)
print("Logical NOT:", logical_not)
```

### Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

``` python
x = 10
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
x -= 3  # Equivalent to x = x - 3
x *= 2  # Equivalent to x = x * 2
x /= 4  # Equivalent to x = x / 4
x %= 2  # Equivalent to x = x % 2
x **= 3  # Equivalent to x = x ** 3

print("Updated x:", x)
```
### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates various types of operators in Python:

```python
# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 3
result = a + b * 2

# Comparison Operators
x = 5
y = 7
is_equal = x == y

# Logical Operators
p = True
q = False
result = p and not q

print("Arithmetic Result:", result)
print("Comparison Result:", is_equal)
print("Logical Result:", result)
````
In the above code:

Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators are demonstrated.
The print() function is used to display the results.
Operators enable you to perform a wide range of operations in your Python code!



## Conditions

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions and perform different actions based on certain conditions.

### IF Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```
### IF-ELSE Statement
The if-else statement is used to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it's false.

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside.")
else:
    print("It's not too hot.")
```
### IF-ELIF-ELSE Statement
The if-elif-else statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check.

```python
grade = 85

if grade >= 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("Good job.")
else:
    print("Keep working hard.")
```

### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of conditional statements in Python:

```python
# IF Statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

# IF-ELSE Statement
y = 3
if y % 2 == 0:
    print("y is even")
else:
    print("y is odd")

# IF-ELIF-ELSE Statement
time = 18
if time < 12:
    print("Good morning!")
elif time < 18:
    print("Good afternoon!")
else:
    print("Good evening!")
```
In the above code:

Different types of conditional statements are demonstrated.
The print() function is used to display the corresponding output.
Conditional statements are essential for controlling the flow of your program based on different situations!


# Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements allow you to control the execution of your program by making decisions based on conditions and looping through code blocks.

## IF Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

### IF-ELSE Statement
The if-else statement is used to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it's false.

``` python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside.")
else:
    print("It's not too hot.")
```
### IF-ELIF-ELSE Statement
The if-elif-else statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check.

```python
grade = 85

if grade >= 90:
    print("Excellent!")
elif grade >= 70:
    print("Good job.")
else:
    print("Keep working hard.")
```
### WHILE Loop
The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```
### FOR Loop
The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print("Fruit:", fruit)
```
### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of control flow statements in Python:

```python
# IF Statement
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

# IF-ELSE Statement
y = 3
if y % 2 == 0:
    print("y is even")
else:
    print("y is odd")

# IF-ELIF-ELSE Statement
time = 18
if time < 12:
    print("Good morning!")
elif time < 18:
    print("Good afternoon!")
else:
    print("Good evening!")

# WHILE Loop
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1

# FOR Loop
for num in range(3):
    print("Number:", num)
```
In the above code:

Different control flow statements are demonstrated.
The print() function is used to display the corresponding output.
Control flow statements allow you to create dynamic and flexible programs that respond to various conditions and iterations!


## Collections

Collections in Python allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. There are several types of collections available.

### Lists

Lists are ordered and mutable collections that can hold different data types.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, "apple", True]
```

You can access elements in a list by their index, and you can modify, add, or remove elements.

```python
print(fruits[0])  # Outputs: "apple"
fruits[1] = "orange"
fruits.append("grape")
fruits.remove("cherry")
```
### Tuples
Tuples are ordered and immutable collections. Once created, you can't modify their content.

```python
coordinates = (3, 5)
person = ("Alice", 30, "female")
```
Accessing elements in a tuple is similar to accessing elements in a list.

```python
print(person[0])  # Outputs: "Alice"
```
### Sets
Sets are unordered collections that store unique values.

```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry"}  # Duplicates are ignored
```
You can perform various set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

```python
new_colors = {"yellow", "blue"}
all_colors = colors.union(new_colors)
```
### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. They are unordered and mutable.

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "female"
}
```
You can access values using keys and update them.

```python
print(person["name"])  # Outputs: "Alice"
person["age"] = 31
```
### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of various collection data types in Python:

```python
# Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1])

# Tuples
coordinates = (3, 5)
print(coordinates[0])

# Sets
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
print("green" in colors)

# Dictionaries
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}
print(person["age"])
```
In the above code:

Different collection types are demonstrated with sample operations.
The print() function is used to display the output.
Collections provide efficient ways to store and manage multiple values in your Python programs!


## Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code that can be called with different inputs to perform specific tasks. They help in organizing and modularizing code.

### Defining Functions

In Python, you define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing parameters. The code block indented under the function definition is the function's body.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

### Calling Functions
Once a function is defined, you can call it by using its name followed by parentheses, passing in the required arguments.

```python
greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```
### Return Statement
Functions can return values using the return statement. This allows you to capture and use the result of the function's computation.

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)
```
### Default Arguments
You can provide default values for function parameters. If a value is not provided when calling the function, the default value is used.

```python
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

print(power(3))        # Outputs: 9
print(power(2, 3))     # Outputs: 8
```
### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of functions in Python:

```python
# Defining a Function
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Calling Functions
result = square(4)
print("Square:", result)

# Using a Function with Default Argument
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    print(greeting + ", " + name + "!")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob", "Hi")
```
In the above code:

A function is defined to calculate the square of a number.
Functions are called with various arguments.
A function with a default argument is demonstrated.
Functions are essential for writing modular and organized code that can be reused across your program.


## Lambda Functions

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, unnamed functions that can have any number of arguments but only one expression. They are often used for short operations.

### Syntax

Lambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by the arguments and the expression. The result of the expression is automatically returned.

```python
# Syntax: lambda arguments: expression
square = lambda x: x ** 2
```

### Using Lambda Functions
Lambda functions can be assigned to variables and used just like regular functions.

```python
# Using the lambda function
result = square(4)  # Outputs: 16
```
### Lambda with Other Functions
Lambda functions are commonly used with other functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
```
### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of lambda functions in Python:

```python
# Defining a Lambda Function
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y

# Using the Lambda Function
result = multiply(3, 5)
print("Result:", result)

# Using Lambda with map()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)
```
In the above code:

A lambda function is defined to multiply two numbers.
The lambda function is used with the map() function to square numbers.
Lambda functions are handy for writing short and concise operations in your code.


## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists by applying an expression to each item in an iterable (e.g., a list or range).

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a list comprehension is:

new_list = [expression for item in iterable]

## Using List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are used to create new lists with transformed or filtered elements from an existing iterable.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
```
### Nested List Comprehensions
You can use nested list comprehensions to create lists of lists or apply multiple transformations.

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [x for row in matrix for x in row]
```
### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of list comprehensions in Python:

```python
# Using List Comprehensions
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]

print("Original Numbers:", numbers)
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)
print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)

# Nested List Comprehensions
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [x for row in matrix for x in row]
print("Flattened Matrix:", flattened)
```
In the above code:

List comprehensions are used to create new lists based on existing data.
Nested list comprehensions are used to flatten a matrix.
List comprehensions are a powerful way to simplify your code when working with iterables and creating new lists.



































## Virtual Environments

Setting up new projects within a folder called "Coding" on your desktop and using a virtual environment for each project is a good practice in software development. This approach helps keep your projects organized, isolated, and prevents dependency conflicts between different projects. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. Create a Folder on Desktop:

   1.1. Right-click on your desktop and select "New" > "Folder".
   
   1.2. Name the folder "Coding" or any other suitable name you prefer.

3. Set Up New Projects:

   2.1. Open the "Coding" folder you just created.
   
   2.2. Create a new subfolder for each project. Name these subfolders based on your project names (e.g., "ProjectA," "ProjectB").

5. Virtual Environments:

   A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects that allows you to manage dependencies separately for each project. Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment for each project:

   3.1. Open a command-line interface (Terminal, Command Prompt, etc.).

   3.2. Navigate to the directory of your project within the "Coding" folder:

   ``` bash
   cd path\to\Desktop\Coding\ProjectA
   ```
   3.3. Create a virtual environment for your project:

   ``` bash
   python -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>
   ```
   Common convention is to name your virtual environment .venv
   ``` bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   
   3.4. Activate the virtual environment:

   On Windows:
   ``` bash 
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   (NOTE: replace ".venv" with your virtual environments name if you have chosen something other than the common convention naming)
   
   On macOS and Linux:
   
   ``` bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   3.5. You'll notice that the command prompt changes, indicating that you're now within the virtual environment.

   3.6. Install project-specific dependencies within this virtual environment using pip:

   ``` bash
   pip install package-name
   ```
   3.7 To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working on the project, simply enter:
   
   ``` bash
   deactivate
   ```
7. Repeat for Each Project:

   Repeat steps 3.2 to 3.7 for each new project you create within the "Coding" folder. Each project will have its own isolated environment and dependencies.

8. Working with Projects:

   8.1. Whenever you want to work on a specific project, navigate to its folder and activate its virtual environment as shown in step 3.4.

   8.2. When you switch between projects, deactivate the current virtual environment (step 3.7) before activating the new one.

By following these steps, you ensure that each project has its own isolated environment, preventing dependency clashes and making it easier to manage and collaborate on multiple projects within the "Coding" folder on your desktop.
